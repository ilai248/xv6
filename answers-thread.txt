1.  This is caused because of a race condition between the 2 threads (with the following event sequence):
    thread1: put(1, 100)
    thread2: put(6, 100)

    thread1: Check if the key's hash (1 % 5 = 1) already exists (key not found)
    thread2: Check if the key's hash (6 % 5 = 1) already exists (key not found)

    thread1: Call insert() with the key's current entry (NULL)
    thread2: Call insert() with the key's current entry (NULL)

    thread1: Insert the new key (1) before the given entry (the entry that insert was called with, NULL)
    thread2: Insert the new key (6) before the given entry (the entry that insert was called with, NULL)

    Only one of the keys was actually inserted, so one of the keys is missing.
